Logic:
    mg creates map of all possible moves a colour can make. ie. all light moves.
    user clicks two squares.
    build `Move` from user clicks
    check if user move in mg moves.
    replace user move with corrected flag move.
    end turn, repeat.

    when mg builds we loop through all pieces and build their moves. So I think
    it's easier to have pieces return `Move` instances and then just build
    attacking maps from their toSq locations.

Refactors:
    have all pieces return `Move` instances not Locations.
    or have mg
